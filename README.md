# MachineLearning-for-Prediction-and-Analysis-of-Urban-Water-Quality
A cutting edge approach to water management using machine learning
The quality of water is important for the prevention and control of waterborne disease. So this project aims at building a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict water quality by considering all water quality standard indicators.
